# The Clean Coder
[The clean coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) is a book authored by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin). This is one book of many in Roberts clean series.

## High level overview
This book is about uncle bob's take on what it means to be a professional programmer. Some of the key skills this book tries to take on are

* What it means to behave as a software craftsman.
* How to deal with tight schedules and demanding managers.
* How to get into good coding habits.
* How to avoid burnout.
* How to manage your time.
* How to foster an environment where programmers can thrive.
* How and when to say no.
* How and when to say yes.

## Notes

### Forward
This forward contains an interesting annectdote in which Robert worked with another manager. In this time he pushed he team hard to meet a deadline. By the desciption of pushing hard it seemed like the conduct to his fellow developers was poor. When all was said and done the developers meet their goal but due to a legal team with a different proirty structure, their efforts had been in vein. The interesting takeway is that the legal team in this story was treated as professionals while the software engineers had not been treated the same way.

### Preface
This preface while outlining the books contents also contains another interesting annectdote. This annectdote is actually 3rd hand and is about the engineers and the failure of engineering and management on the challenger project. This failure ultimately lead to the death of seven individuals and the slow down in space exploration in the United States.

### Professionalism
* Being a professional is something to be proud of, but it means that you need to take on more accountability.
* Professionals do not cut corners to meet a deliverable target.
* Call for a hyppocratic oath for software.
* Sending broken code to QA is unprofessional. QA should not be finding known bugs.
* professionals know code works. They know this because they use rigous testing practices.
* professionals do no comprimise structure to devliver a feature. Doing so sets future work up for failure.
 * mention of the boy scout rule and various other topics from clean code.
 * code should always be changing (constantly refactored)
* it is not your employers job to handle your future
 * employers should not have to pay for your training
 * employers should not have to send you to conferences
 * employers do not have to give you work time to laarn something new
* The only thing you owe your employer is an amount of time and effort (40 hours a week)
* Professionals should spend 60 hours a week on programing (thats right 20 hours of personal time a week)
 * Uncle bob argues that since you can focus on whatever topic you like this should not lead to burnout. In personal experience I pretty much agree.
* Professionals know their field.
 * You should be aware of what is happening in your field
 * Just because a publication or idea is old does not mean that it is irrelevant now. (read old publications)
 * Every software professional should know the following
  * Design patterns (GOF book mentioned)
  * Design principles (SOLID)
  * Methods (XP, Scrum, Waterfall, etc)
  * Disciplines (TDD, OOP, etc)
  * Artifacts (UML, DFD, etc)
* This is a feild of continuous learning.
* Professional practice often.
* Collaboration is a key skill
* Mentoring is a great way to learn.
* Know your domain. If you are entering a feild you should read up on the domain you are going to be working in.
* Understand that the employers problems are your problems.
* Professionals should be humble not arrogant.
* Statement I am not sure I agree with. If you caused a bug that cost the company 10k you should be willing to pay for it out of your paycheck.

### Saying No
* starts off with a tale of bob being pressured to complete a project too quickly.
 * Manager would not budget on date
 * bob and team did not have the spine to stand up to the manager.
 * result was a disaster
  * intermittent bug caused terminals to lock up at a rate of 1 time per hour.
  * could not roll back the change but pressure to fix it faster was mounted (4 weeks was unacceptible)
* Professionals know how to say no.
* Saying no to your boss is not unprofessional, agreeing and falling short is.
* Advesity is a good thing. Developers should stand their ground that is doing your job. Likewise managers should pressure for quicker turn around while understanding the developers. It is also their job to see things done on time.
* Never agree to try. That implies you can do more and you have been holding something in reserve.
* Do not compromise estimates, stand your ground. If timelines are an issue provide a reasonable feature expecatation (we can have feature x but it will be missing y is that alright?)
* Be direct with your estimates.
* If you hit a snag that could comprimise an estimate let management know as soon as possible.
* Be a team player.
* Do not be passive agressive. An example is keeping a log of memos to use against someone later instead of trying to resolve the issue.
* cost of saying yes. This is an interesting article about a developer that agreed to an unreasonable project with shifting requirements under a rediculous time frame. In the end this project died and the developer felt remourse about the terrible code they created.
 * bob aruges that the developer or his employer is at fault.
