It only seems fitting that I start this like I would any other programming adventure, with a hello world.

I have decided its time to create a personal site and attach a blog while I am at it. I have no idea how consistent I will be about making posts or updating this site but I figure its worth a shot.

I am hoping to use this blog to track the things I have learned and any frustrations I have encountered along the way. If nothing else I hope this will serve as documentation for my future self.
