# Book Notes
Recently I have found that some of the books on the topic of software engineering and other business endeavors have somewhat left me as time goes on. Ideally, I should be taking notes or at least capturing some insight on these topics as I read these books.

Every once in a while I will be adding a post about some book I have read. It might not be well thought out and the format is probably going to read like notes with some reflection.

Since this site is mostly for me and I doubt I have an audience I think this is acceptable. If you have an issue with these posts I am sorry but they are not really for you. If you get value out of them great.

If you are not interested in this topic I will be sure to prefix all articles with the Title `Book Note`.
