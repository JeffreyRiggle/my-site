# Whats old is new (to me)
TODO: Explain why I did this

Expections below:
* Will take time to get used to
* learning hotkeys will be slow
* eventually I suspect I am going to add more plugins or tmux
* end result will be pleasant

## Getting started
TODO: Talk about the choice to use neovim over vi or vim

TODO: Talk about the overwhelming amount of suggested plugins and setup options

TODO: Talk about minimal setup
* Neovim
* Standard config (no lua)
* First round of plugins
    * airline
    * nerdtree

## Keybindings don't have to have a modifier?

## Spolied on sensible defaults
Talk about how most IDEs paper over the defaults and when you have to think about them it can be a pain. Ex: indent size on javascript files

## Something clever about plugins
TODO: Talk more about the plugins I initially installed

TODO: Talk about how as time went on I needed more and more plugins

TODO: Talk about adding CoC and the issues I had with it

TODO: Talk about adding fzf (probably the best thing I added)

## Now do it again
Talk about having to do it all over again for my laptop and the things I found doing that

## Enter tmux
Talk about finally breaking down and using tmux and how big of a deal that was

## What I learned

* I like this setup sometimes but I would probably never use it full time
* There are certain features I really expect to be able to use in my dev environment
    * Signature information (help)
    * Autocomplete
* Really enjoyed the hotkeys and the power of visual vs edit mode
