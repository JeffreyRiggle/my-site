# Growth through reflection

Lately, I have been busy with my day job, and the work I am doing on the side is not something I am ready to share publicly. This has left me wanting to share something, but unsure of what to share. After some consideration, I found that there is something I can write about without requiring the focus of a full public project.

Spending some time looking at the work I have done in my spare time, I realized I am missing a key part of learning. In much of my work, I focus on generating a product or prototype to learn something new. Throughout this process, I have learned a fair amount through repeated efforts and failures along the way. However, I rarely go back and look at what I have done years later to reflect on what I did right or wrong. As of writing, I now have 51 source repositories on GitHub, and I think it’s about time to start reflecting.

## Upcoming content
I intend to create a collection of blog posts about my past public projects on GitHub. In these blog posts, I intend to cover the following topics.

* Loosely, why I started the project.
* The constraints I had on the project.
* An overview of using the project in its current state.
* A dive into how the project exists now. This would include topics such as code structure, architectural patterns, and other considerations.
* A reflection on what I like and dislike about the state of the project.

Some of these projects are big and will need to be split across several posts. I also do not intend to post regularly about this, and expect that there may be some blog posts focused on what I am learning with the other project I am not currently sharing publicly.
